# Goethe Institute A1 Word List (vocab, sentences, translation, with audio)

## About this Deck

This is the Goethe Institute's A1 wordlist (including example sentences), translated into English, using double-sided cards and machine-generated audio.
The original document is available (here)[https://www.goethe.de/pro/relaunch/prf/de/A1_SD1_Wortliste_02.pdf].

I translated the words and sentences personally, and a professional German->English translator proofread the results.
Both of us are native English speakers, so there are unlikely to be errors, but we are only human.


## How it was created.

I created this deck by opening the wordlist document and exporting the list of words and associated example sentences.
This was not a scripted process, and involved quite a lot of spreadsheet and text editor adjustments to get things into a reasonable state.

I included the additional snippets of vocabulary that appear before the list proper, but without example sentences since none were provided.
This extra vocabulary is primarily colours, months, days, numbers, units, and other elementary concepts that will likely be useful,

The audio was created automatically by google cloud using the AwesomeTTS Update plugin, which saved me a tremendous amount of work, and saved everyone else from having to listen to my voice :)


## What to expect

The front of each card is a german word with an example sentence.
Verbs are provided in the infinitive and nouns with their definite articles.

Where a word has multiple translations and sample sentences, these were split into individual notes.
This avoids a word having only one translation, which may not appear in the translated sample sentence (without it being a tortured rephrasing).


## Last words

I hope this deck is useful. If you find any errors then please let me know by emailing ankistuff@ethernull.org and I'll take a look.
Before you email though, please consider whether what is already in the deck is an equally valid (albeit alternative) translation.
In such cases I would not update the deck, as adding a second sample sentence would reduce format consistency and make the note less accessible for users who are just getting started.
